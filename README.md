BH Grasshopper Tools

The Grasshopper toolkit contains a lot of projects, some of them having additional dependencies on the rest of our code. You can either unload those projects in Visual Studio or clone and compile the required repositories. Check [the wheel](http://cchub.burohappold.com/?selected=Grasshopper_Toolkit&codeDim1=repo) to see the current dependencies for each project.
