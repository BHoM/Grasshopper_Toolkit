# Alligator
BH Grasshopper Tools

### Build Alligator from Source ###
You will need the following to build Alligator:

- Microsoft Visual Studio 2013
- [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)
- Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 and above (included with Visual Studio 2013)
- BHoM version 0.0.1
- RobotToolkit version 0.0.1
- Ensure post-build folders are accessible:

The Grasshopper toolkit contains a lot of projects, some of them having additional dependencies on the rest of our code. You can either unload those projects in Visual Studio or clone and compile the required repositories. Check [the wheel](http://cchub.burohappold.com/?selected=Grasshopper_Toolkit&codeDim1=repo) to see the current dependencies for each project.
